## Lesson - Git
The free lesson you are reading is on Git.

Git is a Version Control System, or 'VCS'. It takes snapshots of the state of files when changes are made. It is extremely beneficial and necessary on any large software project. It is a red flag if a software development company is not enforcing the use of version control.
